    heading: The directory contains details of hundreds of financial advisers who can help you with your financial decisions whether you are thinking about retirement; semi-retired but still working or fully retired.
    items:
      - text: We are independent and set up by government so our results are impartial.
        tooltip:
      - text: All the advisers on the directory are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) so you can have peace of mind that you are dealing with a regulated firm and are fully protected.
        tooltip: The FCA is the UK’s financial regulator and sets rules which advisers must follow when providing advice and selling financial products. This means you are covered if things go wrong and they can be fined or shut down if they break the rules. Regulated financial advisers must also have a certain level of qualifications before they can practice, which is set by the FCA.
      - text: All the advisers on the directory offer personalised financial advice and can choose from a wide range of products and providers.
        tooltip: This means Advisers must collect enough information from you to be able to make a personal recommendation. If the recommendation turns out to be unsuitable you can complain firstly to the firm the Adviser works for and then the Financial Ombudsman if your complaint is turned down. Advisers on the directory are also covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme meaning you’ll be able to claim compensation if you lose money as a direct result of them going bust.

  workplace_scheme:
    question: Are you a member of a union or other affinity group?
    tooltip: Some unions or other affinity groups (and some of the larger pension schemes) may have already selected an Adviser or panel of Advisers you can choose from. You might want to check this before finding one on your own. If there is a pre-selected firm you can use you can always speak to them and one or two more from the directory to compare service and costs.
