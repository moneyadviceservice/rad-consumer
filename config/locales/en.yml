        header: How near is your adviser?
        text: Many firms have advisers who don’t work from the office all the time and are based in different parts of the UK. So don’t worry if the address of the firm seems far away, there should be an adviser located near to the post code you’ve entered. Advisers will also usually give you a choice of where to meet.

    heading: Search our directory of regulated advisers
    items:
      - text: All advisers are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
        tooltip: The FCA is the UK’s financial regulator and sets rules that firms employing financial advisers must follow when providing advice and selling financial products. This means you are covered if things go wrong and they can be fined or shut down if they break the rules. Regulated financial advisers must also have a certain level of qualifications before they can practice, which are set by the FCA.
      - text: All advisers offer personalised financial advice
        tooltip: This means advisers must collect enough information from you to be able to make a personal recommendation. If the recommendation turns out to be unsuitable you can complain firstly to the adviser’s firm and then to the Financial Ombudsman if your complaint is rejected. Advisers on the directory are also covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme meaning you’ll be able to claim compensation if you lose money as a direct result of them going bust.
